# TomatoFighters Toolkit Reference

## Commands

| Command | Args | What it does |
|---------|------|--------------|
| `/build-app` | `--resume`, `--phase` | Full orchestration from planning to production. Runs the entire pipeline: plan → cluster → budget → execute → handoff → learn. |
| `/execute-phase N` | phase #, `--dry-run`, `--budget`, `--stop-on-failure` | Runs all tasks in a phase. Groups them into parallel batches respecting dependencies, spawns agents, collects results. |
| `/do-task` | task ID, `--budget`, `--skip-test`, `--verbose` | Executes a single task through the 8-step pipeline (analyze → context → plan → implement → validate → test → commit → report). |
| `/task-execute TXXX` | task ID (e.g., T001) | Lightweight autonomous task execution. Reads the task spec, picks the right agent, implements, and commits. |
| `/generate-task-specs` | phase #, task ID, or range (e.g., T014-T025) | Generates detailed execution-ready spec files from TASK_BOARD.md one-liner summaries. |
| `/check-pillar` | pillar name or `all` | Scans C# `using` statements to verify no cross-pillar imports. Catches Combat→Roguelite leaks etc. |
| `/sync-docs` | `full\|status\|changelog\|tasks\|summary` | Updates the docs repo to match current code state — task statuses, changelog entries, SUMMARY.md navigation. |
| `/scan-repo` | `--force` | Indexes the codebase by pillar, domain, and namespace so agents pick better context. |
| `/capture-learnings` | `--phase N` | Extracts reusable patterns, gotchas, and retrospective notes from completed work. |

## Agents — Code Generation

| Agent | Model | What it does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| `shared-contracts` | sonnet | Writes cross-pillar interfaces, enums, data structs, and SO event channels in `Scripts/Shared/`. |
| `combat-agent` | sonnet | Implements combat systems: movement, combo chains, hitboxes, defense mechanics, pressure gauge, ability execution. |
| `roguelite-agent` | sonnet | Builds progression systems: stat calculation, path trees, ritual triggers, currency, persistence, meta-unlocks. |
| `world-agent` | sonnet | Creates world systems: enemy AI, boss patterns, wave spawning, camera, UI/HUD, room navigation, co-op wiring. |
| `so-architect` | haiku | Designs ScriptableObject data classes with `[CreateAssetMenu]` attributes. Fast and focused on the data layer. |
| `ability-agent` | sonnet | Implements all 36 path abilities (4 characters × 3 paths × 3 tiers) and integrates them into the combat system. |
| `integration-agent` | sonnet | Wires systems across the 3 pillars. Creates test scenes, verifies interface connections, resolves cross-pillar handshakes. |
| `balance-agent` | haiku | Tunes numeric values: damage curves, stat scaling, difficulty progression, economy balance, cooldown timings. |

## Agents — Pipeline & Meta

| Agent | Model | What it does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| `task-planner` | sonnet | Interactive planning sessions. Discuss approach, surface tradeoffs, flag risks, align on strategy before coding. |
| `task-spec-writer` | sonnet | Transforms one-liner task summaries into detailed specs with acceptance criteria, file lists, and dependencies. |
| `task-analyzer` | haiku | Analyzes a task description and extracts: domains touched, pillar ownership, task type, and recommended agent. |
| `phase-planner` | sonnet | Reads the task board and builds an optimized execution plan: batch grouping, dependency ordering, budget estimates. |
| `phase-orchestrator` | sonnet | Coordinates phase execution at runtime. Sequences and parallelizes tasks, handles handoffs between agents. |
| `quality-gate` | haiku | Final checks before commit: code style, naming conventions, pillar boundaries, missing XML docs. |
| `test-validator` | sonnet | Validates completed work against acceptance criteria, coding standards, and TomatoFighters conventions. |
| `documenter` | haiku | Generates audit trail markdown: what was built, what changed, decisions made, caveats for future devs. |
| `docs-writer` | haiku | Writes and maintains GitBook-formatted documentation pages with consistent linking and SUMMARY.md navigation. |
| `repo-scanner` | sonnet | Indexes the Unity repo into a structured map by pillar, domain, namespace, and file relationships. |
| `agent-tailor` | sonnet | Creates new specialized agents on demand, following existing conventions and prompt patterns. |

## MCP Servers

| Server | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `mcp-for-unity` | Bridges Claude Code to the Unity Editor via HTTP on port 8080. Enables scene inspection, component queries, asset operations, and running editor scripts directly from Claude. Requires the Unity project to be open. |
| `agent-tailor` | Creates new specialized agents on demand via the AgentTailor API. |

## Typical Workflow

```
1. /generate-task-specs 1          ← spec out Phase 1 tasks
2. use task-planner for T001       ← discuss complex tasks before coding
3. /task-execute T001              ← execute a single task
4. /execute-phase 1                ← or run the whole phase in batches
5. /check-pillar all               ← verify no cross-pillar violations
6. /sync-docs full                 ← update documentation
7. /capture-learnings --phase 1    ← extract patterns for future phases
```
